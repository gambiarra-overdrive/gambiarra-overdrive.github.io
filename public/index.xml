      <description>Description # This binary was compiled by an hand-crafted, artisan racket compiler, courtesy of UMD&amp;rsquo;s very own CMSC430 class.
Reversing # The attachment was an standard x64 ELF file. After opening it in my decompiler, and going to the main function, everything seemed pretty straight.
Investigating this sub_17e0 function we see that it has a lot of deep nested conditionals, where in each step it calls read_byte() and then compares it to a byte.</description>

      <description>This is the harder version of donations, it&amp;rsquo;s the same challenge, but you can&amp;rsquo;t donate negative amounts this time.
After playing with it for a while, I realized that the solution was probably to find a way to donate money to your user, bypassing that Jeff Bezos check. So I tested adding more user id&amp;rsquo;s in the to parameter and the money went to them.
So the solution was to create users, and donate all of their money to a user which will retrieve the flag.</description>

      <description>After downloading and prettifying the javascript code we see that there&amp;rsquo;s a /api/flag and a /api/donate endpoints.
The flag route returns:
{&amp;#34;detail&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;only the wealthy may view the treasure...&amp;#34;} After trying some things that didn&amp;rsquo;t work, I went to the donate functionality. Using the parameters that I found in the javascript I is playing with this funcionality and noticed that you can only donate to a specific user
{&amp;#34;detail&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;you may only donate to Jeff Bezos&amp;#34;} And somehow that Jeff Bezos&amp;rsquo;s id is lisanalgaib</description>
